# Lab 10

## Goals

* Use Python to:
    * Create grader account
    * Install updates
    * Install packages
        * OpenSSH, vim, curl, git, fortune, man
    * Add SSH public key to grader account

## Python

Use python subprocess functionality to create a single python script to do the required functionality mentioned in the goals [1]. 

For 10 points Extra Credit: Write it so it prompts the user for their sudo password vs requiring the script to be run as root. 

## Submitting Assignment

Verify that you can see your files on GitHub for the repo under the *assignment10* branch. Also make sure your branch is named correctly or it will not be pulled for grading.
