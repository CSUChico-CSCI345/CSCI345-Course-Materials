# Lab 6

## Goals

* In Docker Image:
    * Create grader account
    * Install updates
    * Install packages
        * vim, curl, git, fortune, man, Nginx
    * Configure Nginx
    * Default container to grader account
        * Multiple ways to do this but could run an infinite loop in the foreground and let nginx remain a background service.
